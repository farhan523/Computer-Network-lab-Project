# Computer-Network-lab-Project

In This final Project, we conducted a topology using cisco packet tracer.
The topology contains 5 networks connected via Router that represent university departments.
We connected devices using IPv4, We configured classful and classless netmask of all the networks
To support Ip need, We configured DHCP server for the dynamic allocation of ip 
Addresses to all the hosts connected to the network, We Configured the DNS server 
For the resolution of web domains. We configured the HTTP server and hosted 
University website with domain uos and secure the server using FIREWALL to block
ICMP ping for scanning. We implemented FTP server where files can be uploaded and downloaded by the user whose credentials are saved. We also set up Email server 
For the sending and receiving emails.
